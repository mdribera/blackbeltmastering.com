Our expertise in cutting physical vinyl masters has allowed us to work on releases by Metallica, George Harrison, Beyonc√© and the JOKER soundtrack which won an Academy Award. 


  We're proud to offer both digital mastering and lacquer cutting for vinyl. Cutting is performed on one of our restored Neumann lathes. We've cut thousands of LP's and have the experience to help you get the best sounding vinyl record possible.
