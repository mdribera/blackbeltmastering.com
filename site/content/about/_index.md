  Owned and operated by Levi Seitz, Black Belt Mastering is a fully equipped
  audio mastering facility that was established in 2009. Our goal is to create a
  cohesive master for either digital or vinyl release, retaining musicality and
  impact.


  We have mastered and/or cut RIAA gold and platinum certified, Billboard #1, Grammy and Academy Award winning records. Some notable releases have been for SYML, August Burns Red, Pearl Jam, Metallica and the JOKER soundtrack. 


  In addition to producing digital masters, we're proud to offer master lacquer cutting for vinyl. Cutting is performed on one of our 2 Neumann lathes. We've cut thousands of LP's and have the experience to help you get the best sounding vinyl record possible.


  Don't hesitate to reach out...we enjoy working on projects of all sizes and look forward to working on a record with you!
