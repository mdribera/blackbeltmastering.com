  <h3>Vinyl Mastering</h3>

  <p><b>Master Lacquers: Contact for Pricing</b></p>

  <p><b>12‚Äù / 10" / 7"</b> - Our Neumann lathe is equipped with an advanced 'Pitch18' cutting computer from Switzerland that cuts longer sides with better land use and retains more clarity on longer sides compared to other cutting systems.</p>


  <p><b>Half Speed Cutting</b> &mdash; Superior clarity and enhanced stereo imaging. The increased depth and transient articulation of a half-speed cut will elevate your music on vinyl.</p>

  <p><b>Audio in lock groove</b> &mdash; A continuous audio loop cut in to the lock groove at the end of your side.</p>

  <br/>

  <p class='small'>Completed lacquers are express shipped to the pressing plant of your choice, and the cost for this is approximately $80. Shipping is paid for by you, the client. Whenever possible, we will combine multiple orders to lower the shipping cost.</p>

  <p class='small'>Shipping, paper sleeves and protective cases for acetates are included in the price.</p>
