  faq:
    - question: How much will mastering cost?
      answer: Singles are $120, 2 or more songs are $60/each. 5 songs would cost $300 and 10 songs would cost $600.  Attended sessions are $75 per song.
    - question: What do I get once we’re done?
      answer: Once the mastering process is complete, and payment has been made, you will receive fully sequenced WAV masters of all your songs along with a DDP image that can be used for CD manufacturing. Other formats, such as MFiT or 24 bit vinyl ready masters can be provided on request and are listed on the RATES page.
    - question: What information do you need before starting my session?
      answer: "Please provide the following info: Song order, Artist or Band name, Album Title, Song Titles, ISRC codes (if you have them)."
    - question: Do you accept mix notes or use reference tracks?
      answer: Yes. If you'd like to provide a reference song I will gladly accept it. This is a great way for me to get a feel for the sound you are after. I also find it helpful to include a few brief notes if there are specific song transition requests. Ultimately, a quick phone call is best.
    - question: Can I attend the mastering session?
      answer: Yes, I encourage attended sessions. Sessions start at 10am. Attended sessions allow you to be involved and understand the mastering process from beginning to end and provides you access to ask questions and hear immediate before and after mastering samples of your record. Sessions can take anywhere from as few as 3 hours for short EP’s to 5+ hours for longer, more involved LP’s.
    - question: How do I send you my mixes?
      answer: You can send mixes by clicking this link for <a href='https://www.wetransfer.com/'>wetransfer.com</a> or by forwarding a link to a Dropbox folder.
    - question: What formats do you accept?
      answer: We proudly accept 1/2" and 1/4" reels of analog tape, 1-bit DSD, WAV or AIFF files.<br/><br/><b>Digital</b> songs should be delivered as Stereo. We prefer to accept 24bit / 44.1k or higher, but can accept others if necessary. Please do not send MP3's or ‘lossy’ audio. Make sure there is no distortion or clipping as it's best to start with the highest possible quality.<br/><br/><b>Analog</b> reels (either 1/2” or 1/4”) should be delivered with tones of 10kHz, 1kHz and 100Hz at a level of 0VU. At least 30 seconds of each tone with 10 seconds of silence in between at the end of a reel is appreciated. Please number and label your tape boxes with the tape speed, reference level and the EQ standard that was used. If possible, please organize the songs in the correct running order (as they will show up on the record) with sufficient leader tape at the top and tail. As a backup, supplying a digital copy of each song on a thumb-drive is recommended.
    - question: How loud should my mixes be?
      answer: Unless intended for artistic reasons, please omit any "loudness" or "brick-wall limiting" plugins from the stereo bus of your mix. If you are unsure as to what level to deliver your song, a good suggestion is to have the digital peaks approaching -3dBFS and an RMS value below -15dBFS. It's always nice to have some headroom to work with!
    - question: Do you offer revisions?
      answer: Yes, one free hour of revisions is included with each session. If for whatever reason you want to change something related to mastering after receiving your initial reference master, it’s on me! Any revisions beyond the first hour are billed at an hourly rate of $100 per hour.
    - question: Do you offer samples of your mastering work?
      answer: If you are a new client considering Black Belt Mastering for the first time and are unsure about how your mixes will sound after being mastered here, please contact us and we can discuss your project.
    - question: Are you really a black belt?
      answer: Yes, in the first degree. I studied Tae Kwon Do from age 12 through college with short studies in Wing-Chun Kung-Fu.

  title: Vinyl
  faq:
    - question: What vinyl services do you offer?
      answer: "<ul><li>Reference Acetates &mdash; A one-off evaluation cut you take home
        and play to discover how your record will sound on vinyl.</li><li>Master Lacquers
        &mdash; These are individual 'Side A' and 'Side B' master lacquer discs that are
        cut and shipped to the pressing plant for mass production of vinyl records.</li><li>Digital
        Cutting Masters &mdash; If we did the initial mastering for your record and you're
        choosing to have lacquers cut elsewhere, we can provide the 24&mdash;bit side
        A and B digital files and required timing log.</li></ul>"
    - question: How much does lacquer cutting cost?
      answer: '12" lacquers are $180/side and 7" lacquers are $100/side. Please see the
        RATES page for more details. '
    - question: How long can each side of my record be?
      answer: While CDs can hold over 70 minutes of material, this is essentially impossible
        for a single 12" record. There's only so much physical space to pack the grooves.
        As the length of a side goes up the loudness goes down because the grooves on
        the record have to be cut with less side-to-side movement (quieter) to fit more
        information in the allotted space. Very long sides are possible, but not very
        loud.<br/><br/>Please use the information below as a guideline for timing sides:<br/><table><tr><td><b>12"
        (33 1/3 RPM)</b><br/><span class='small'>Best &mdash; 18 minutes per side</span><br/><span
        class='small'>OK &mdash; 20 minutes per side</span></td><td><b>12" (45 RPM)</b><br/><span
        class='small'>Best &mdash; 8 to 9 minutes per side</span><br/><span class='small'>OK
        &mdash; 12 minutes per side</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>10" (33 1/3 RPM)</b><br/><span
        class='small'>Best &mdash; 8 to 9 minutes per side</span><br/><span class='small'>OK
        &mdash; 13 minutes per side</span></td><td><b>10" (45 RPM)</b><br/><span class='small'>Best
        &mdash; 6 to 7 minutes per side</span><br/><span class='small'>OK &mdash; 10 minutes
        per side</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>7" (33 1/3 RPM)</b><br/><span class='small'>Best
        &mdash; 6 minutes per side</span><br/><span class='small'>Meh &mdash; 8 minutes
        per side</span></td><td><b>7" (45 RPM)</b><br/><span class='small'>Best &mdash;
        3 minutes per side</span><br/><span class='small'>OK &mdash; 5 minutes per side</span></td></tr></table>
    - question: What is a Matrix number, how do I get one?
      answer: Both myself and the pressing plant will ask you to provide what's known
        as a matrix number. The matrix (sometimes also called the 'catalog number') is
        something that you create or your record label provides you, it is not generated
        by the pressing plant. The matrix you give me is physically etched into the master
        lacquers and serves as a way for the plant to track your record throughout the
        manufacturing process. It's usually an abbreviation of your record label or band
        name along with a number (i.e. RHR-009 or SDRE0217).
    - question: I’ve never released a vinyl record before, what do I need to know?
      answer: "<ul><li>First, select a record pressing plant to press your records and
        submit an order with them. A pressing plant will need to electroplate the master
        lacquers to create metal stampers, and will then use the stampers in the manufacturing
        of your finished records. Let the plant know that you are providing your own lacquers
        (from me). I should not be cutting your master lacquers until you have a confirmed
        order set with a pressing plant. The plant needs to be expecting lacquers from
        me. If a pressing plant receives lacquers that are not accounted for, they will
        not get processed.</li><li>Second, schedule time to have a reference acetate cut.
        An acetate will allow you to listen to and evaluate your record on a home turntable,
        to potentially catch any problems or things you'd like changed before master lacquers
        are cut. We highly recommend getting an acetate, as this is the perfect time to
        attend a cutting session and see the process first-hand. Checking the sound at
        every stage of the process is paramount and prevents potential delays and frustration.
        (See FAQ about acetate evaluation below.)</li><li>Third, book a session to have
        master lacquers cut. Sessions to cut master lacquers are not attended. One lacquer
        is needed for each side of a record. A single album needs 2 lacquers created,
        a double LP would need 4, etc. Let me know where the project is being pressed,
        and once the masters are cut I’ll express ship the lacquers directly to it or
        the corresponding plating facility.</li><li>Finally, A few weeks after everything
        is sent to the plant you'll receive test pressings of your record. These are a
        small batch of finished records. Most plants require approval of test presses
        before manufacturing the bulk of your order. Once you approve the test presses
        the plant will complete the rest of your order.</li></ul>"
    - question: How should I evaluate an acetate, is it like a test pressing?
      answer: Acetates are more than double the weight of a test pressing and are cut
        on aluminium discs that are coated with nitrocellulose lacquer with a finish coat
        of acetate for curing; they are not made of vinyl like a test pressing. If your
        acetate sounds like a good vinyl translation then it can be approved.<br/><br/>Please
        note, if your record player is inexpensively made or has a low torque motor the
        acetate may play back inconsistently or with warble; this is a turntable issue,
        not a problem with the acetate or overall cut. Some things to consider when evaluating
        an acetate at home:<br/><br/><ul><li>Handle your acetate by the edges only. Avoid
        touching the surface where the grooves have been cut.</li><li>If your turntable
        has difficulty playing your acetate, adjust your tonearm's counterweight or stylus
        force; a worn or damaged stylus can mar the grooves or distort the sound of the
        acetate.</li><li>Your acetate is for reference only. Acetates are a softer material
        than vinyl and will only last a few plays at maximum fidelity before getting noisy.
        Use it to evaluate the sound of the cut on one or two trusted playback systems
        before it begins to degrade.</li></ul>
    - question: How should I evaluate test pressings?
      answer: "<ul><li>First off, it's important to note that test pressings are not always
        perfect. Still, in order to properly evaluate them you should be confident that
        your record player is calibrated with the recommended  'stylus force' for your
        phono cartridge and has an anti-skate setting that will prevent your tonearm from
        swaying side to side.</li><li>About a month after your lacquers have been submitted
        to the plant, you'll receive a box of test pressings (usually 5 copies). The first
        thing you should do when opening the box is number the tests 1-5, this will help
        when taking notes and referencing a specific copy.</li><li>Please do not disperse
        the test pressings (to friends or family or kickstarter contributors) before they
        have been fully approved, the whole point in evaluating them is to have all copies
        at-hand and available for comparison should an issue be discovered.</li><li>True
        problems worth reporting back to the pressing plant are ones that are repeated
        on each and every test pressing in exactly the same way every time. For example,
        if you hear a loud 'zip' sound in the middle of the second song on test pressing
        1 and again on 2 but not on 3, 4 and 5. It's just a random anomaly and not something
        that will be on the final production run of records.</li><li>However, if you discover
        a distracting skip or loud 'pop' or 'swish' sound that happens at the same moment
        on all 5 pressings in exactly the same way, this is something worth documenting
        and contacting myself or the pressing plant about.</li><li>Please be sensitive
        to accept the reality of how vinyl sounds, the random clicks and pops that are
        present in one test pressing but do not repeat in others are not a cause for concern,
        they are part of what makes vinyl unique. 'Diameter loss' (when a record sounds
        successively less-bright and a bit more 'gritty' as you get closer to the inner
        diameter) is also normal to hear on vinyl. Keep in mind, we're talking about an
        audio format that reproduces sound by a microscopic shard of diamond scratching
        through a plastic trench the width of two human hairs and then amplifying those
        mechanical vibrations to then recreate the original sound so it's just going to
        sound reasonably different!</li><li>I don't find it helpful or constructive to
        compare the test pressings to the digital masters as it's likely that the vinyl
        pre-master (and thus the actual vinyl) will potentially have a bit more dynamic
        range and just 'feel' different than the digital (it's not a 1:1 transfer, so
        don't treat it like one). It's also worth noting that vinyl generally has a 'softer'
        and less-bright treble as well the low-end will usually be tighter with not as
        much low-frequency extension and less stereo feel to the bass. There are physical
        limitations to vinyl and it would be counter productive to expect it to have the
        same clarity and frequency response as a digital counterpart that is without the
        same mechanical constraints.</li><li>If you ever have questions about what is
        and is not a problem with test pressings you should consult with the person who
        cut the lacquers (me). I can often help you understand what is or isn't an actual
        issue of concern. I can also help be a liaison between the pressing plant and
        plating facility to help discover where an issue is stemming from, ultimately
        a new side may need to be cut to best resolve a problem.</li><li>Be wise, plan
        ahead and give yourself extra time to account for potential setbacks. The process
        of making vinyl records is not quick and all stages leading up to the pressing
        happen in real time with little to no automation. Great sounding vinyl is worth
        the extra time!</li></ul>"
    - question: Who do you recommend for pressing?
      answer: <a href='https://www.gottagrooverecords.com/'><b>Gotta Groove Records</b></a>
        - High quality art printing and pressing for 7" records as well as standard and
        180g 12" records.<br/><a href='http://www.rainborecords.com/vinyl.htm'><b>Rainbo
        Records</b></a> and <br/><a href='http://www.erikarecords.com/10in%20Vinyl%20Record%20and%20Jacket.pdf'><b>Erika
        Records</b></a> - Both plants press 10" records and picture records.<br/>
    - question: Can you cut lacquers at half-speed or cut audio in to the lock groove
        at the end of a record?
      answer: Yes, we can do both. Our Neumann lathe is equipped with the most advanced
        direct drive motor that can spin at 16 2/3RPM which allows more detail to be cut
        in to the grooves and yields a more pronounced stereo image and articulate treble
        with full bass. Cutting an endless loop of audio into the lock groove of a record
        is also possible, the duration of the loop should be exactly 1.8 seconds at 33
        1/3 RPM and 1.33 at 45 RPM.
