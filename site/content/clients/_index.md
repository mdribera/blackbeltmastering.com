testimonials:
  - artist: "Don Farwell (Producer/Engineer/Owner: Earwig Studio)"

    quote: "Almost all of my mix sessions end with the question: 'Where should I go
      for mastering?' I promptly hand them one of Levi's business cards and tell
      them to go to Black Belt Mastering. Why? He's close to my studio in
      Seattle, his rates and equipment are great and he makes my mixes sound
      killer! An extra bonus is that he's a helluva nice guy and very passionate
      about his work."

      Justice - Seattle, WA)"

    quote: Levi turns around world-class work at the speed of sound. I've been
      really happy with everything I've brought to Black Belt.

    quote: Levi at Black Belt Mastering is our first choice for cutting our vinyl
      projects. His knowledge and attention to detail as well as communication
      with us throughout the process is excellent. Whether it's a short single
      or an album that pushes the limits of vinyl, Levi keeps it sounding great
      and playing well. We are fortunate to have him locally but I would use him
      no matter where I was. The test pressings and lacquers are clean and
      quiet. They are a great representation of what the manufactured disc will
      sound like and if I have any questions I get a timely response. Levi gets
      it right the first time.

    quote: Working with Levi was one of the best Mastering experiences I've ever
      had. He was super flexible, easy to communicate with, and I could tell
      that helping me realize my vision for the record and be happy with the
      final product was really important to him. I highly recommend working with
      him if you get the chance!
