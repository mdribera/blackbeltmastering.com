testimonials:
 - artist: "Don Farwell (Producer/Engineer/Owner: Earwig Studio)"

   quote: "Almost all of my mix sessions end with the question: 'Where should I go for mastering?' I promptly hand them one of Levi's business cards and tell them to go to Black Belt Mastering. Why? He's close to my studio in Seattle, his rates and equipment are great and he makes my mixes sound killer! An extra bonus is that he's a helluva nice guy and very passionate about his work."
 - artist: "Chris Walla (Engineer/Producer/Musician: Death Cab For Cutie/Hall of Justice - Seattle, WA)"

   quote: "Levi turns around world-class work at the speed of sound. I've been really happy with everything I've brought to Black Belt."
 - artist: "John Burton (Pearl Jam Recording & Archiving)"

   quote: "Levi at Black Belt Mastering is our first choice for cutting our vinyl projects. His knowledge and attention to detail as well as communication with us throughout the process is excellent. Whether it's a short single or an album that pushes the limits of vinyl, Levi keeps it sounding great and playing well. We are fortunate to have him locally but I would use him no matter where I was. The test pressings and lacquers are clean and quiet. They are a great representation of what the manufactured disc will sound like and if I have any questions I get a timely response. Levi gets it right the first time."

   quote: "Working with Levi was one of the best Mastering experiences I've ever had. He was super flexible, easy to communicate with, and I could tell that helping me realize my vision for the record and be happy with the final product was really important to him. I highly recommend working with him if you get the chance!"
